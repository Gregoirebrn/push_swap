The Push swap project is a simple and effective algorithmic exercise: you have to sort data.
You have at your disposal a set of integers, two stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate them.
Your goal? Write a C program named push_swap that calculates and displays on
the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
allowing to sort the integers passed as parameters.
